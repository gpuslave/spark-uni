Note that applications should define a main() method instead of extending scala.App. Subclasses of scala.App may not work correctly.

This program just counts the number of lines containing ‘a’ and the number containing ‘b’ in the Spark README. Note that you’ll need to replace YOUR_SPARK_HOME with the location where Spark is installed. Unlike the earlier examples with the Spark shell, which initializes its own SparkSession, we initialize a SparkSession as part of the program.

We call SparkSession.builder to construct a SparkSession, then set the application name, and finally call getOrCreate to get the SparkSession instance.

Our ppliction depends on the Sprk PI, so we’ll lso include n sbt configurtion file, build.sbt, which explins tht Sprk is  dependency. This file lso dds  repository tht Sprk depends on:
